# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of data science projects. This collection showcases a variety of techniques and methodologies applied across supervised and unsupervised machine learning projects. Below is a summary of key techniques demonstrated within these projects.

## Techniques Overview
- **Regression Analysis**: Linear and log-linear regression models with advanced feature engineering.
- **Uncertainty and Confidence Intervals**: Statistical rigor in model interpretation using bootstrap methods.
- **Cross-Validation**: K-fold cross-validation to optimize model performance and avoid overfitting.
- **Regularization**: Lasso and Ridge regression to manage multicollinearity and reduce model complexity.
- **Classification**: Implementation of classification models for predictive analytics.
- **Clustering (K-means)**: Segmentation and clustering for pattern recognition in high-dimensional data.
- **Tree-Based Models**: Use of decision trees and ensembles for classification and regression tasks.
- **Matrix Factorization**: Dimensionality reduction techniques applied to complex datasets.

Each project folder contains a README with detailed explanations of objectives, methodologies, and findings. 

Loving the stuff WJ from FB ;)
